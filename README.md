We proposed BSC-Nav (Brain-inspired spatial cognition for navigation), which leverages bio-inspired spatial cognition mechanisms to continuously understand the surrounding environment by constructing structured spatial memory, supporting general navigation and more advanced spatial intelligence. Our paper is currently under review, and all features will be made publicly available in the near future.

### 🧐 Environment & Dataset preparation

### 🎮 Quick start with BSC-Nav !


### 🎯 Benchmarks


### 📆 TODO
- [x] Upload all experimental scripts for both simulator and real environments
- [ ] Release general navigation reproduction instructions
- [ ] Provide vision-language navigation and A-EQA documentation for reproduction
- [ ] Provide physical environment navigation and mobile manipulation reproduction instructions
